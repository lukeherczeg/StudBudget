## Who created StudBudget?

StudBudget was created by a group of 7 UF Computer Science and Engineering students for a class project. For more information, see the _Authors_ section below.

#### Using StudBudget: A Note

To run a full version of StudBudget with GUI display on your computer, please contact one of the authors listed below for all the necessary files. This is because Qt is required to visualize the GUI. (More on this in _Deployment_)

## Getting Started

In order to build this app, we had a team of 7 that was split into several main areas (see _Authors_ below for who did what):

* Backend -- Calculations
* Frontend -- Qt GUI
* Data Visualization -- Using QtCharts
* Integration -- Combining the frontend and backend

### Prerequisites

Coding StudBudget required prior knowledge of C++, but some things we were able to learn along the way included:

* GitHub
* Qt
  * QtCreator
  * QtCharts
  * QtDesigner
* Databases (using text file(s))
* User Authentication / Login system
* Encryption, Security, Hashing

### Installing for Open Source use

You will need to clone this GitHub repository (or make your own if you're starting from scratch), and download Qt.

We used the commercial trial of Qt, which only lasts for a short period of time, but you may be able to extend it if you contact the company. The Qt installation may take some time.

You can also use the open source version of Qt, which is free but does not include all the same features. Visit Qt's website for more details.

## Deployment

Deployment was difficult using Qt. We were able to deploy the app for Windows by creating a standalone .exe file, but deploying for Mac proved to be more difficult.

It may be easier to start off using Qt Open Source, as it allows you to deploy the app more easily, it is free, and your access to it will not suddenly end like the commercial trial.
